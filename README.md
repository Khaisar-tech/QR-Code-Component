## My process

### Built with

* Semantic HTML5 markup
* CSS custom properties
* Flexbox
* Responsive design using media queries

### What I learned

I learned how to center content perfectly using Flexbox and how to make components responsive with media queries. This project helped me understand how to scale elements proportionally for smaller screens.

### Continued development

I plan to continue improving my responsive design skills and start exploring CSS Grid and animations in future projects.
